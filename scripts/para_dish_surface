say

def r d s;
# assigns the aliases r, d, s for radius, depth, surface

ask @r dish radius (of the rim plane);
ask @d dish depth (from the vertex to the rim plane);
# asks for dish radius and depth

calc ((math.pi * @r) / (6 * @d **2)) * (:(@r **2 + 4 * @d **2) **3 - @r **3)
# calculates surface

set @s;
# assigns value to variable

say
say parabolic dish surface is @s = &@s
# prints solution
