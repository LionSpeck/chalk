say ### quadratic equation solver ###
say ### ax2 + bx + c = 0
say

def a b c x;
# assigns the aliases a, b, c for the coefficients, x1, x2 for the solutions

ask @a first coefficient;
ask @b second coefficient;
ask @c third coefficient;
# asks for coefficients

calc ((-@b + :(@b **2 - 4 * @a * @c)) / (2 * @a) , (-@b - :(@b **2 - 4 * @a * @c)) / (2 * @a))
# calculates solutions as a tuple

set @x;
# assigns tuple to @x

say
say solutions are @x = &@x
# prints solutions
