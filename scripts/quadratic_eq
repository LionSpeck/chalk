say ### quadratic equation solver ###
say ### ax2 + bx + c = 0
say
def a b c x1 x2;
ask @a first coefficient;
ask @b second coefficient;
ask @c third coefficient;
set @x1 to (- @b +:( @b **2-4* @a * @c ))/(2* @a );
set @x2 to (- @b -:( @b **2-4* @a * @c ))/(2* @a );
say
say greater root is &@x1
say smaller root is &@x2
