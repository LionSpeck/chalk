def *<var>
	assigns aliases to the given <var>s.
	If no <var> is given, prints current aliases.

Aliases are called with @<alias>, and invoke the corresponding variable.
Variable names cannot be manually assigned, as the names are given by the 'let' command.

Aliases can be reassigned, calling 'def' with the same aliases once more.
