calc <equation>
	(also called with '=')
	evaluates the equation and assigns it to the currently manipulated variable.

	Variables can be used in the equation, as well as math (python module) constants.

	In case of variable name ambiguity, the calculation will not be executed. It is mandatory, when a variable name of more than a single character is used, to separate it with whitespaces.
