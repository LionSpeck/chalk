calc <equation>
	(also called with '=')
	evaluates the equation and assigns it to the currently manipulated variable.

If calc is called with '?', the result will not be assigned to the manipulated variable.

Variables can be used in the equation, as well as math (python module) constants.
Variables should be separated by whitespaces, to avoid ambiguity.

Additional operations:
- '^' scientific notation (*10**)
- ':' square root (math.sqrt)
- '!' factorial (math.factorial)
- ''' transpose matrix (np.transpose)
- '%' percentage calculation (*0.01*)

You can use quick operands to affect the manipulated variable:
'+=', '-=', '*=', '/='
