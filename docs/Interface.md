# chalk documentation: the Command Line Interface

The main interface for chalk is its command line input: it allows for quick operations and sending all of your commands. On the left, it always shows within angle brackets `< >` the name of the currently manipulated variable, right beside its value. By default, this variable is `ans`, but it can be changed at any time with the `man` command.

On the right of the command input symbol `$`, you can type your commands and calculations.
