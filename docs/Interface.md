# chalk documentation: the Command Line Interface

The main interface for chalk is its command line input: it allows for quick operations and sending all of your commands. On the left, it always shows within square brackets '[ ]' the name of the currently manipulated variable. Right beside it, within brackets '( )', you can see at all times what the value of the manipulated variable is. By default, this variable is 'ans', but it can be changed at any time with the 'man' command.

On the right of the command input symbol '> ', you can type your commands and calculations.
